## Day 2 - November 1, 2025

### Completed
- [x] **Provider Layer (Phase 2)**
  - [x] **Abstraction Layer:**
    - [x] Built the provider abstraction layer in `allos/providers/base.py`, including `BaseProvider`, `Message`, `ToolCall`, and `ProviderResponse` dataclasses.
    - [x] Implemented a decorator-based `ProviderRegistry` in `allos/providers/registry.py` for easy extension.
    - [x] Wrote unit tests to validate the abstraction layer and registry.
  - [x] **OpenAI Provider:**
    - [x] Implemented `OpenAIProvider` targeting the new Responses API.
    - [x] Added logic for message/tool conversion and robust error handling for `openai` exceptions.
    - [x] Wrote comprehensive unit tests, achieving 100% coverage for the provider.
  - [x] **Anthropic Provider:**
    - [x] Implemented `AnthropicProvider` targeting the Messages API, correctly handling its unique system prompt and tool-use lifecycle.
    - [x] Added metadata collection to mirror the OpenAI provider's observability.
    - [x] Wrote comprehensive unit tests, achieving 100% coverage for the provider.
  - [x] **Integration and Verification:**
    - [x] Created a framework for optional integration tests using a `--run-integration` flag in `pytest`.
    - [x] Wrote and successfully passed integration tests for both OpenAI and Anthropic providers against their live APIs.
    - [x] Wrote and successfully passed a provider-switching integration test, validating the core promise of the SDK.
    - [x] Fixed the critical bug where the provider registry was empty for end-users by adding side-effect imports to `allos/providers/__init__.py`.
  - [x] **Documentation:**
    - [x] Populated all relevant documentation files for Phases 1 and 2, including installation, quickstart, guides, and contribution instructions.

### In Progress
- [ ] None. Phase 2 is complete.

### Blockers
- **Resolved:** A series of minor but critical issues were discovered and fixed through iterative testing:
  - **OpenAI Schema:** The integration test failed due to a missing `additionalProperties` field in the generated tool schema, which was required by the live API.
  - **Anthropic Behavior:** The integration test failed due to an incorrect assumption that Anthropic would not return text content alongside a tool call. The test was updated to reflect the actual API behavior.
  - **Type Safety:** Mypy errors in the `AnthropicProvider` revealed incorrect assumptions about the structure of the message `content` field and the `error.body` attribute, which were fixed.
  - **Test Structure:** Pylance warnings led to refactoring both provider test suites to test the public interface (`.chat()`) rather than private methods, making the tests more robust.
  - **Critical End-User Bug:** A final manual test revealed that the `ProviderRegistry` was empty because the provider modules were not being imported. This was fixed by adding side-effect imports.

### Tomorrow
- [ ] Begin Phase 3: Tool System.

### Notes
- Integration testing is invaluable. It caught multiple subtle mismatches between our implementation and the live API contracts that unit tests could not.
- The most critical bug (the empty registry) was found by simulating a real end-user's workflow. This highlights the importance of simple, top-down testing.
- Documenting as we complete phases, rather than at the end, is much more efficient and ensures accuracy.
