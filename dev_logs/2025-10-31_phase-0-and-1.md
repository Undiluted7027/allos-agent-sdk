## Day 1 - October 31, 2025

### Completed
- [x] **Project Foundation (Phase 0)**
  - [x] Set up the GitHub repository and initial directory structure.
  - [x] Wrote the comprehensive `README.md` to establish the project's vision.
  - [x] Designed the initial architecture and created the `MVP_ROADMAP.md`.

- [x] **Core Infrastructure (Phase 1)**
  - [x] **Project Configuration:**
    - [x] Created `pyproject.toml` with all core, development, and optional dependencies.
    - [x] Created `setup.py` for backward compatibility.
    - [x] Created `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt` for reference.
    - [x] Configured `.gitignore`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, and `.env.example`.
  - [x] **Workflow Upgrade:**
    - [x] Switched the entire development workflow from `pip` to the much faster `uv`.
    - [x] Updated `scripts/setup_dev.sh` to be more robust, use `uv`, and prefer Python 3.9.
  - [x] **Utility Modules:**
    - [x] Implemented a custom exception hierarchy in `allos/utils/errors.py`.
    - [x] Set up a rich, colored logging system in `allos/utils/logging.py`.
    - [x] Created secure file operations in `allos/utils/file_utils.py` to prevent directory traversal.
    - [x] Built a token counting utility in `allos/utils/token_counter.py`.
  - [x] **Testing Infrastructure:**
    - [x] Created `tests/conftest.py` with reusable fixtures for mocking providers/tools and creating temporary directories.
    - [x] Created the `scripts/run_tests.sh` test runner script.
    - [x] Wrote the first unit tests (`tests/unit/test_utils.py`) to validate the setup and utilities.
  - [x] **Package Finalization:**
    - [x] Created `allos/__version__.py` as the single source of truth for the version.
    - [x] Set up the main package entry point in `allos/__init__.py`.
    - [x] Added a unit test to verify the version is correctly exposed.

### In Progress
- [ ] None. Phase 1 is complete.

### Blockers
- None. All issues were resolved through iteration.

### Tomorrow
- [ ] Begin Phase 2: Provider Layer.

### Notes
- Adopting `uv` from the start has significantly improved the developer experience with fast dependency installation and environment setup.
- Establishing a robust test infrastructure and pre-commit hooks in Phase 1 ensures a high standard of code quality from the very beginning.
