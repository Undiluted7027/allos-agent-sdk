This example is a placeholder for a feature that is currently under development.

Feature: Agent Core (Phase 4)

This file will be populated with a working example demonstrating how to build a
code review agent once the `Agent` class and the main agentic loop are implemented.

Please see the project's roadmap for more details on our development timeline:
- MVP Roadmap: ./../MVP_ROADMAP.md
- Full Roadmap: ./../ROADMAP.md

Thank you for your interest!
