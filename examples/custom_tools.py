This example is a placeholder for a feature that is currently under development.

Feature: Custom Tools (Phase 3)

This file will be populated with a working example demonstrating how to define
and use your own custom tools with the Allos SDK.

Please see the project's roadmap for more details on our development timeline:
- MVP Roadmap: ./../MVP_ROADMAP.md
- Full Roadmap: ./../ROADMAP.md

Thank you for your interest!
