This example is a placeholder for a feature that is currently under development.

Feature: Agent Core & Shell/Web Tools (Phase 3 & 4)

This file will be populated with a working example demonstrating how to build an
SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) agent that can diagnose issues using shell
commands and web search once these features are implemented.

Please see the project's roadmap for more details on our development timeline:
- MVP Roadmap: ./../MVP_ROADMAP.md
- Full Roadmap: ./../ROADMAP.md

Thank you for your interest!
